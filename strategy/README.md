# Strategy Design Pattern
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

Capture the abstraction in an interface, hide implementation details in implementation classes.

3 elements:
1. Context: when the strategy is used
2. Strategy: a common interface for the supported algorithms
3. Implementations: Concrete algorithm that implements the interface defined by Strategy.
